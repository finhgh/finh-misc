            <p>I first went about making the pen model by measuring a normal ballpoint pen's dimensions using vernier calipers.
                Then I created the inital model in Autodesk Fusion360 where multiple bodies were created to form the pen.
            </p>

            <img src="../pages/images/pen-scene-setup.jpeg" alt="Scene Setup" class="hv-images">
            <p> Using the exported model, I was able to setup a scene with a bunch of pens suspended above a small cup.
                 The idea being that a physics simulation could be ran to get a more natural positioning for each of
                 the pens in the pot. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 The physics is never accurate but once the simulation is ran, I can touch up the geometry
                 of all of the pens to ensure that they aren't clipping into each other. After this, their translated
                 positions can be made permanent.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="section">
            <p>With all of the pen models in position I was now confident in building some sort of scene
                that could be used within the render. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The base/floor underneath the pen bot was beveled initially with Blender's built-in function fo the same name.
                This was applied to the vertical edges of the base. Using the HardOps addon, you can perform a global bevel 
                to the whole base. Having a high enough polygon count in both of the boolean operations allows for a "smooth finish".
                <br>
                <br>
                An "L" shaped box was positioned as the background and smoothed out with a singular boolean operation.
                Having a gap between the base and the background allowed for depth. Similar to
                a corner of a desk in the corner of a room.

        <div class="section">
            <img src="../pages/images/pen-positioned-lighting.jpeg" alt="Initial Lighting" class="hv-images">
            <p>Determining the lighting against the pens was important so I tested out different planar and spot lights
                to achieve a good amount of brightness and reflection before applying any further materials.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>Now that the positioning of the pens and the main lighting has been established, all that is left is the 
                scene lighting and the materials.
                <br>
                <br>
                Using the nodular effects system I can produce the shiny plastics, fogged glass and soft matte colours
                 needed to perfect the scene. No texture mapping was needed.
                <br>
                <br>
                The render was then optimised for a better quality than what the default render settings provided.
