            <p>I first went about making the pen model by measuring a normal ballpoint pen's dimensions using vernier calipers.
                Then I created the inital model in Autodesk Fusion360 where multiple bodies were created to form the pen.

            <p> Using the exported model, I was able to setup a scene with a bunch of pens suspended above a small cup.
                 The idea being that a physics simulation could be ran to get a more natural positioning for each of
                 the pens in the pot. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 The physics is never accurate but once the simulation is ran, I can touch up the geometry
                 of all of the pens to ensure that they aren't clipping into each other. After this, their translated
                 positions can be made permanent.
